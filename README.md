#### This is just a note pad for thoughts about this app



## Features

# User accounts
# Add client changed to add person?
- basic add person pop up has save and save & open
- Save and open will add them like normal, but it will then open up a full profile page for that new person.
- This will give the option to do a quick add or add plus expand on the initial info.

# The projects will be changed to details? maybe ... The other stuff... idk?
- this will allow you to add each different thing that you know about the person as it's own thing.
- standard stuff (age, pronoun, relationship status, where you know them from) will just be on the person page, but even those things can be expanded with details entry


# Wishfull thinking list
